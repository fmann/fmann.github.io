### Comments

##### "I Wanna Be Your Lover" ⭐️

The big single. A great one. [His first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp8WL621uGM) includes him singing, playing guitar, drums, bass, and keyboard.

##### "Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?"

Another solid tune. A bit rockier, almost has the vibe of a song by The Cars.

##### "Sexy Dancer" ⭐️

A straight up 80s tight funk banger.

##### "When We're Dancing Close and Slow"

An unremarkable ballad.

##### "With You"

A slightly more memorable ballad that builds up nicely.

##### "Bambi"

The rockiest jam of the album.

##### "Still Waiting"

A catchy laid back little song.

##### "I Feel For You"

Chaka Khan had a bigger hit with her cover with Stevie Wonder on harmonica in 1984 than Prince did with original. I enjoy both versions.

##### "It's Gonna Be Lonely"

One more ballad to close out the album. Probably the most memorable of the slow songs on the album. Prince hadn't yet quite found his voice with these but you can tell he's working on it.
