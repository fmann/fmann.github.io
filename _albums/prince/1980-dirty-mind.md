### Comments

##### "Dirty Mind" ⭐️

A good catchy intro track. One of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3GPPnVz1fw"></a>his earlier music videos</a>.

##### "When You Were Mine"

Never been one of my favourites but it is not a bad tune. Covered by Cindy Lauper later.

##### "Do It All Night"

Synthy intro. Good song but unremarkable for Prince.

##### "Gotta Broken Heart Again"

The one slow song on the album. Unmemorable.

##### "Uptown" ⭐️

Tied with "Head" for my favourite track. 123bpm so totally works with a four on the floor house beat. Crystal Water's 1997 cover goes hard.

##### "Head" ⭐️

A funk classic. Slower at 110bpm. As far as I can recall the first song of his featuring someone else's voice.

##### "Sister"

I don't think I was aware Prince had a song about incest. Ew.

##### "Partyup"

Solid Prince/Morris Day funk tune. Ends on a chant of "You're Gonna Have to Fight Your Own Damn War, Cuz We Don't Wanna Fight No More." Which... 1980, I'm not sure what war he'd be talking about, I suspect it is just a general statement of sticking it to The Man.
