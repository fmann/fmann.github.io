### Comments

##### "Eye No"

Funky, slightly chaotic opening track. Lots of extra vocals and background noise, giving it the feel of a live jam.

##### "Alphabet St." 💎

The hit from this album. Starts thin and spare, almost reminiscent of "Kiss", but it fills out as the track proceeds.

##### "Glam Slam"

Synth rock a la "Purple Rain."

##### "Anna Stesia"

A bit unfortunate in retrospect given the nature of his demise.

> Anna Stesia come to me
>
> Talk to me, ravish me
>
> Liberate my mind

##### "Dance On"

Kinda a strange one. Almost has a break beat, but can't quite figure out where is it going.

##### "Love Sexy"

Loud, full, funky song. I like the horns here.

##### "When 2 R in Love"

The slow jam on the album.

##### "I Wish U Heaven"

Probably the most forgettable song on the album. 80s pop, boring guitar "dump dump dump", terrible snare sound.

##### "Positivity"

Weird tune. The snare sound is almost like something out of Kraftwerk.
