### Comments

##### "Can't Stop This Feeling I Got"

Rocky, poppy, not very good.

##### "New Power Generation, Part 1"

Kinda catchy anthem for the New Power Generation, a bit silly.

##### "Release It"

This one is by The Time. This is in that awkward period where clearly hip hop is selling more records than funk or R&B but bands like this can't make the transition but want to nod in that direction.

##### "The Question of U"

Slower song, rocky guitar solo.

##### "Elephants & Flowers"

Shrug.

##### "Round and Round"

House-y tune with Tevin Campbell.

##### "We Can Funk"

Includes George Clinton but I dare say it is kinda a lame song.
