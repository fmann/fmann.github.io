### Comments

##### "Can't Stop This Feeling I Got"

Rocky, poppy, not very good.

##### "New Power Generation, Part 1"

Kinda catchy anthem for the New Power Generation, a bit silly lyrically in a Twisted Sister sort of "Hey old man, we're not going abide by your rules" way.

##### "Release It"

This one is by The Time. This is in that awkward period where clearly hip hop is selling more records than funk or R&B but bands like this can't make the transition but want to nod in that direction.

##### "The Question of U"

Slower song, rocky guitar solo.

##### "Elephants & Flowers"

Shrug.

##### "Round and Round"

House-y tune with Tevin Campbell.

##### "We Can Funk"

Includes George Clinton but I dare say it isn't a very good song. The best part is the last minute or so with the back up singers doing harmony.

##### "Joy in Repetition"

One of the better songs on the album.

##### "Love Machine"

The Time again. Goofy tune.

##### "Tick, Tick, Bang"

Scratching and break beat but doesn't really work. He's trying though.

##### "Shake!"

Dorky song by The Time.

##### "Thieves in the Temple" ðŸ’Ž

The most memorable song from the album and the only hit. Not great but better than the rest of this album.

##### "The Latest Fashion"

Prince and The Time. ... Meh.

##### "Melody Cool"

The woman singing has a good voice. Probably sounds good in a club.

##### "Still Would Stand All Time"

Wouldn't be a Prince album without a gospelly sounding slow jam. Here it is.

##### "Graffiti Bridge"

Cinematically it may work for a big finale but on its own it is hillariously bad.

##### "New Power Generation, Part 2"

Closing credits to the movie, I can only assume. The rapper on here isn't bad actually.
