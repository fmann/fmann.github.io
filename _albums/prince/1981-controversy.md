### Comments

##### "Controversy"

Prince's greatest song to-date, has a fatter sounds than anything he'd done before. The bass just bump bump bumps on the beat but it works. The synth, the guitar, and the bass all sound great together. The bridge is fantastic and the track just keeps trucking along at 119bpm.

Includes the Lord's Prayer for no reason I can fathom than just creating controversy.

##### "Sexuality"

More New Wave-y, less funk than much of what he's done up until now. No bass that I can hear, just a synth bass line.

##### "Do Me, Baby"
