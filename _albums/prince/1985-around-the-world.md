### Comments

##### "Around the World in a Day"

A forgettable opening track aside from the use of some "exotic" instruments.

##### "Paisley Park"

Kinda cute sing-songy tune. Not a banger but I like it.

##### "Condition of the Heart"

A very quiet ballad that doesn't really go anywhere, alas.

##### "Raspberry Beret" 💎

Not my favourite but indisputably this was a huge hit and pretty "hippie" in it's day in an 80s Ferris Bueller retro kind of way.

##### "Tamborine"

I've never really thought of a tambourine as a sexual object or metaphor but, hey, it's Prince, who wondered "Can I fuck it?" about most everything.

##### "America"

Poppy and a bit political. Not terrible.

##### "Pop Life" ⭐️

Definitely my favourite tune on the album.

##### "The Ladder"

The two things I hate in 80s pop are gated reverb snare drums and shmaltzy sax. It is mixed pretty quietly, thank goodness, but the sax here is bad.

##### "Temptation"

The sax here at least is kind of weird. Wait, is that gated reverb snare? Fuuuuu...

Oooooohhh... __That's__ what he's talking about! I thought he just wanted another cookie.

(And then God smites him? WTF is up with that? This boy needs to learn to be more sex positive.)
