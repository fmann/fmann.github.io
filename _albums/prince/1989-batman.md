### Comments

This was actually the first Prince album I bought. I think I bought it before the movie came out, when Slash wore a Batman t-shirt. As an impressionable 15 year old, I bought into the hype.

##### "The Future"
##### "Electric Chair"
##### "The Arms of Orion"

Duet with Sheena Easton, who I met when I worked at a light rock station. Sounds like a 90s Disney soundtrack duet.

##### "Partyman"
##### "Vicki Waiting"
##### "Trust"
##### "Lemon Crush"

Pretty forgettable, though I do remember it.

##### "Scandalous"

I actually had forgotten this one.
##### "Batdance"
