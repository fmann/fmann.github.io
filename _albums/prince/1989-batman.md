### Comments

This was actually the first Prince album I bought. I think I bought it before the movie came out, when Slash wore a Batman t-shirt. As an impressionable 15 year old, I bought into the hype.

##### "The Future"

One of the better songs on the album.

##### "Electric Chair"

Too much 80s snare but not a bad song.

##### "The Arms of Orion"

Duet with Sheena Easton, who I met when I worked at a light rock station. Sounds like a 90s Disney soundtrack duet.

##### "Partyman"

The biggest hit from the album. It's a good song.

##### "Vicki Waiting"

Not a bad song.

##### "Trust"

Fast paced, almost like something The Time would do.
##### "Lemon Crush"

Pretty forgettable, though I do remember it.

##### "Scandalous"

I actually had forgotten this one.
##### "Batdance"

I do like the break here after the beat drops and it gets funkier.
