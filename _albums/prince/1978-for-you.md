### Comments

##### "For You"

An a capella intro. Relatively forgettable.

##### "In Love"

"In Love" is a solid. Funky but tight, super 80s synth sounds.

##### "Soft and Wet" ⭐️

This was the hit single from the album. Tight, only in the break really does some disco four on the floor sneak through.

##### "Crazy For You"

An acoustic-y ballad. A bit shmaltzy.

##### "Just as Long as We're Together"

The longest track on the album. Some disco-y throwbacks, a few reminders of Graham Central Station, but you can also begin to hear the stabs in the break that Prince and The Time would become notorious for. Makes me want to clap my hands.

##### "Baby"

Another ballad. Stands out because of the real strings, just about the only sounds on the album Prince did not create himself.

##### "My Love Is Forever"

A smooth little jam. Makes me thing of Al Jarreau or Luther Vandross.

##### "So Blue"

Another acoustic-y ballad.

##### "I'm Yours"

Probably the most confusing track on the album. Four bars of slap bass intro then you get hit with a rock drums and guitar intro that sounds like it could be on a Survivor, Journey, or Loverboy track. The song itself mixes funk and hard rock guitar in ways that few artists but Prince and maybe Lenny Kravitz do. Ends hard.
