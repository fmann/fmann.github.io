### Comments

##### "Sign o' the Times"

I've always liked this song but it has that awkward thing which some 80s songs have where artists who are out of touch with "the street" like Prince or Michael Jackson try to sing about the streets the way Marvin Gaye or Curtis Mayfield did. This style was [brilliantly parodied on Flight of the Conchords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLEK0UZH4cs).
