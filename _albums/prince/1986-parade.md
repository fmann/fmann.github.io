### Comments

##### "Christopher Tracy's Parade"

Maybe this makes sense in the context of the movie but it is not a good stand alone song.

##### "New Position"

This one isn't bad. Funky little bassline.

##### "I Wonder U"

Very forgettable. Again, might make sense in the film.

##### "Under the Cherry Moon"

I like this one. Certainly not typical for 80s pop.

##### "Girls & Boys" ⭐️

Catchy as can be, and the screechy little synth stabs totally work. I love the little bits of baritone sax too.

> I love you baby, I love you so much

> Maybe we can stay in touch

> Meet me in another world, space and joy
>
> Vous êtes tres belle, mama, girls and boys

##### "Life Can Be So Nice"

More on the rock side. A little repetative but not bad.

##### "Venus de Milo"

##### "Mountains"

##### "Do U Lie?"

Silly little song with accordion and strings. Charming.

##### "Kiss" 💎

Still a standout track with nothing else really comparable to it.

##### "Anotherloverholenyohead" ⭐️

Solid jam.

##### "Sometimes It Snows in April"

The best ballad on the album.
