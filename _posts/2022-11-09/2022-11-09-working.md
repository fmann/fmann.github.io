I am still working through these. He has a lot of albums, you know.

It sounds silly to mention this but, for the young people, when Prince was putting these albums out, you actually had to pay for them if you wanted to hear them.

I wasn't into Prince at the "Purple Rain" peak. I think I first found his stuff intriguing when "Raspberry Beret" came out, and then definitely thought "Kiss" was cool and unlike anything I'd ever heard when it came out.

The first album of his I bought was the Batman soundtrack in 1989. It wasn't until 1992 or 1993 that I really got into him, but, again, that meant finding and paying for his stuff on cassette, CD, or LP. So some of his albums, like "Parade", I had on vinyl and so only listened to at home, whereas others like "Sign O The Time" I had on CD and so could listen to in the car or on my computer.
