Getting back up to speed this week after travel, I was able to tinker with or learn a bit more about a number of technologies this week.

 - React.js + Typescript + Vite. See [my weather widget](https://fmann.miwomi.net/weather-widget).
 - [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
 - [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot), in particular [using Dependabot with Gitlab](https://kkurko.hashnode.dev/keep-your-dependencies-up-to-date-with-dependabot-on-gitlab).
 - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
